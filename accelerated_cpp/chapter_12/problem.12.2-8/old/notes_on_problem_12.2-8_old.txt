This is the old version of the Str implementation.

This version of Str isn't compliant with C++11 because the Str is not always null terminated.  Strings in C++11 are always null terminated.

The alternative implementation uses always null terminated strings which makes c_str() trivial to implement (return pointer to the underlying data).  By having always null terminated strings this avoids the need for a const_cast on a const object (for c_str()) which should be avoided as per:

This version will also produce an error when accessing the zeroeth element of an empty string.

// Fine, no error, is null terminated always.
String a;
cout << a[0] << endl;


// Error, no memory is allocated and the Str is not null terminated, there is no zeroeth element to access.
Str a;
cout << a[0] << endl;
