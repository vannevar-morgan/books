NENA LYRICS
"99 Red Balloons"

You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'til one by one they were gone
Back at base bugs in the software
Flash the message: "something's out there!"
Floating in the summer sky
Ninety-nine red balloons go by

Ninety-nine red balloons
Floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
Where ninety-nine red balloons go by

Ninety-nine decision street
Ninety-nine ministers meet
To worry, worry, super scurry
Call the troops out in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it, boys, this is war
The president is on the line
As ninety-nine red balloons go by

Ninety-nine knights of the air
Ride super high-tech jet fighters
Everyone's a super hero
Everyone's a captain kirk
With orders to identify
To clarify and classify
Scramble in the summer sky
Ninety-nine red balloons go by

As ninety-nine red balloons go by

Ninety-nine dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standing pretty
In this dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenir
Just to prove the world was here
And here is a red balloon
I think of you, and let it go

Lyrics for Wind of Change by Fred Ventura

Long days without a face
With nothing more to say
Closed in your silent room

Waiting for better days

When the night is coming
There's nothing more to do
She comes walking in silence
Always dressing in blue

Your heartbeat seems to fade
Don't runaway anymore (ooh woa ooh oh oh)
Your anger burns inside
That's not the life you ask for (ooh woa ooh oh oh)

This is the wind of change
There's nowhere to go (nowhere to go)
No time, no place to hide
Anywhere in the world

REFRAIN:
You can get, you can get what you want
Life is so strange and so full of desires
Day by day, try to follow your way
The wind of change is burning out the fire

Out the fire is burning, out the fire
The wind of change is burning out the fire
You can get, you can get what you want
Life is so strange and so full of desires

Don't waste your time again
Too many years have gone (woa ooh oh oh)
You are lying in the dark
Open yourself to the sun (woa ooh oh oh)

This is the wind of change
There's nowhere to go (nowhere to go)
No time, no place to hide
Anywhere in the world

You can get, you can get what you want
Life is so strange and so full of desires
Day by day, try to follow your way
The wind of change is burning out the fire

Out the fire is burning, out the fire
The wind of change is burning out the fire
You can get, you can get what you want
Life is so strange and so full of desires

JIMI HENDRIX LYRICS
"All Along The Watchtower"

"There must be some kind of way out of here,"
Said the joker to the thief,
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Businessmen - they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody of it is worth."

"No reason to get excited,"
The thief - he kindly spoke,
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late."

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl, hey.

THE PROTOMEN LYRICS
"Light Up The Night"

Joe:
This city's sleeping like a soldier
trapped inside of an iron lung,
Machines can keep you breathing
but what happens when you find a new war's begun?
Flip a switch and turn it off, you won't be able to breathe.
So either way you're a casualty.

I've got this burning like my veins are filled
with nothing but gasoline.
And with a spark,
it's gonna be the biggest fire they've ever seen.
Cut me down or let me run,
either way it's all gonna burn...
The only way that they'll ever learn

We've got to turn it off,

Flip a switch.

Light up the night!

There is a city that this darkness can't hide.
There are the embers of a fire that's gone out,
But I can still feel the heat on my skin
This mess we're in, well you and I,
maybe you and I,
We can still make it right.

Maybe we can bring back the light.

Tom:
At the heart of the city there is a building that looks down over all there is.
And the man in the tower controls it all without raising a single fist.
It's like they gathered up the city, they sold it to the devil, and now
It's gone to hell and they wonder how.

Well, a friend once told me:
Men, they would follow any man who would turn the wheels.
Now the wheels are spinning out of control; what would they do if we held them still?
If you destroy the working parts, what you'll get is a broken machine.
A beacon of light from a burning screen.

Light it up.
Light up the night.

Together:
There is a city that this darkness can't hide.
There are the embers of a fire that's gone out,
But I can still feel the heat on my skin.
This mess we're in, well you and I,
maybe you and I,
We can light up the night.

Together:
There is a city that this darkness can't hide.
There are the embers of a fire that's gone out,
But I can still feel the heat on my skin.
This mess we're in, well you and I,
maybe you and I,
We can light up the night.

There is a city that this darkness can't hide
There is a fire that will burn through the streets of the city, and we will stand in the light.
We will stand in the light,
you and I.
You and I.
We can bring back the light.
