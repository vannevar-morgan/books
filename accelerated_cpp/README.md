Accelerated C++
=============================================

My solutions for book exercises in Accelerated C++.

Makefiles and test data are included.

All problems have been compiled and tested using g++-4.8.4-2 on ubuntu 14.04.

It's possible there may be errors - if you find any I'd be interested to know.  I found some problems were ambiguous and solved the problem to my interpretation of the problem.  There are notes describing these cases when applicable.

Personally, I would recommend a better, more up to date book if you're new to c++ - "C++ Primer" (by Stanley Lippman et al) is a good choice to learn modern c++ (c++11).  The exercises get boring in Accelerated C++.  Additionally, Accelerated C++ teaches c++98/03 - it's out of date.  In many of the makefiles I've used the -std=c++11 compile flag (to make use of some c++11 constructs) and they may not work with older compilers.
