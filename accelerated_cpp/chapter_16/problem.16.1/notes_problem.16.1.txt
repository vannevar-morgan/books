Accelerated C++, Problem 16.1:
"Write a self-reproducing program.  Such a program is one 
 that does no input, and that, when run, writes a copy of
 its own source text on the standard output stream."

(What the problem is describing is a quine)

A good resource for getting started:
http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html

Note that when running this program you should redirect output to a file:
ex:
./problem.16.1 > output.cpp

then compare differences between source and output:
diff problem.16.1.cpp output.cpp

For the quine to be correct there should be no differences between source and output.
