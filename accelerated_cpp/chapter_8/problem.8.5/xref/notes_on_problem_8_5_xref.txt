Accelerated C++, Chapter 8, Problem 5, xref notes

You can't use a plain ostream_iterator to print a map<string, vector<int> > to standard output.  You need to write an adapter class that extends std::iterator, and then print in the assignment operator.

I used the code (modified slightly) in listing 5 here:

IMO this is beyond the scope of Chapter 8
