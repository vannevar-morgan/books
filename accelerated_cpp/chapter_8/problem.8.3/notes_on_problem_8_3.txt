Accelerated C++, Chapter 8, Problem 3

Note that with C++11 onwards, move semantics are changed, there's less expense to passing by value.  Since the make file compiles with the -std=c++1y flag, you shouldn't notice much of a difference in time between the template function that passes by value and the template function that operates on iterators.

Testing, I got:

100,000 element dataset
pass by value:    49 ms, 50 ms, 49 ms
using iterators:  48 ms, 48 ms, 48 ms

1,000,000 element dataset
pass by value:    581 ms, 577 ms, 580 ms
using iterators:  570 ms, 575 ms, 569 ms

10,000,000 element dataset
pass by value:    6772 ms, 6781 ms, 6795 ms
using iterators:  6700 ms, 6814 ms, 6763 ms
